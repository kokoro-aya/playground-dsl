# playground-dsl

This is the old repo of Amatsukaze project.

I have applied the Kotlin DSL, together with codegen and eval scripting, to allow players to code in Kotlin code directly in the playground. Therefore no more need for usage of ANTLR and overhead of defining my own language.

Libraries used:

- ktor-server
- ktor-serialization
- kotlin-scripting-jvm-host
- kotlinpoet
